### Hey there, I'm Shinhee Chae!🙋🏻‍♀️

- I'm currently taking a Web Dev course at DCI aiming for MERN stack.
- So far I've learned to speak HTML5, CSS3 and JS. In my repos, you'll find my projects done with VanillaJs and ReactJs. For styling, I use Bootstrap or Material-UI depending on the project. 
- I recently started a back-end course. Sharing ideas would be awesome!🤟🏻
- Or Sunday 10K would be a great chance to get to know each other, so join me anytime🏃‍!

### Hey there, I'm Shinhee Chae!🙋🏻‍♀️

- I'm currently taking a Web Dev course at DCI aiming for a MERN stack developer.
- So far I've learned to speak HTML5, CSS3 and JS. In my repos, you'll find my projects done with VanillaJs or built in ReactJs. For styling, I mainly use Material-UI and SASS. 
- I recently started to build apps using MERN stack. Sharing ideas would be awesome!🤟🏻
- Or Sunday 10K would be a great chance to get to know each other, so join me anytime🏃‍!  
- Drop me a line: shinheechae@gmail.com

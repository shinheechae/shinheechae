### Hey there, I'm Shinhee Chae!🙋🏻‍♀️

- I'm currently taking a Web Dev course at DCI aiming for a MERN stack developer.
- Throughout the course, I've learned to speak HTML5, CSS3 and JS. In my repos, you'll find my projects either done with VanillaJs or built in React. For styling, I use Material-UI and SASS. I build backend & REST APIs using MongoDB and Express.
- Sharing ideas and feedback would be awesome, drop me a line : shinheechae@gmail.com
- Or Sunday 10K would be a great chance to get to know each other, so join me anytime🏃‍!
